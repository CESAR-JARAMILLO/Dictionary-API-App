### What I learned
I learned a better understanding of vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation by practicing and experimenting with code on my own, as well as using online references. The importance of CSS style structure was also emphasized during this  project, as it can greatly impact the overall look and functionality of a website. Additionally, I realized the significance of creating a plan before starting to code, as it helps to organize and prioritize tasks, leading to a more efficient and effective development process.

### Continued development

To continue developing my front-end skills, I plan to stay up to date with the latest technologies and advancements in the field by regularly reading articles, blogs, and participating in online communities. I also plan to work on various projects and experiment with different design and development techniques. Additionally, I aim to apply my backend skills to future projects by incorporating server-side scripting and database management. Furthermore, I intend to implement the use of frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue, and Node.js, to streamline my development process and build more complex and dynamic applications.
